<h1>Sprint 4 Technical</h1>
<h2>1. Got Blocked On A Simple Problem</h2>
  <p>
    I’ve run into a number of small problems learning Javascript, one in particular which seems ridiculous 
    in hindsight and seems to be a bad habit I keep getting into was when doing the Kata challenge I found 
    myself rushing into coding instead of fully understanding and planning the best way to attack the challenges.
    I found going through a process where I would read the challenge in it's entirety and then re-read it while
    translating it into pseudocode step by step made a big difference in my accuracy.
  </p>
<H2>2. Solved A Problem In An Elegant Way</H2>
  <p>
    I’ve solved the problem above of rushing into challenges by making sure I read through the brief once, and then 
    I read through it again while making pseudocode notes, pseudocode is away of writing down the steps you need to 
    take to solve the problem in code, it’s written in plain english but the way a computer would understand it eg.

  <p>
    I also used a technique whike pseudocoding the challenge called 'Rubber Ducking' this is when you atempt to explain
    what you are trying to achieve outloud or to a anyone who is willing to listen.
  </p>
<H2>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</H2>
  <p>
      * Pseudocode - improving with practice
      * Trying something - confident
      * Rubber ducky method - needs work, I find it dificult putting my thoughts into words
      * Reading error messages - this needs more work but I'm understanding them a lot more
      * Console.logging - I find this very useful to show what's working and what's not
      * Googling - Confident
      * Asking your peers for help - this is certainly something I need to work on
      * Asking coaches for help - getting better
      * Improving your process with reflection - I think reflection is key and I quite often rush it so this could do with more practice.
