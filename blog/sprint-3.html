    <h3>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h3>
    <p>
       A simple analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS would be to think of them being the components to build a house. HTML would be the building blocks; foundations, pillars and overall structural integrity of the building. While CSS would then be the aesthetics of the building like colour, textures and design.

    <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h3>
    <p>
      Explaining control flow and loops using a process from everyday life could be related to ‘brushing your teeth’. The control flow is used to describe the order in which your code executes so just like brushing your teeth you need to go through a step by step process in a particular order. 
    </p>
    <p>
      eg. The process in the control flow of brushing your teeth would be:
      <ul>
        <li>Run hot water over your toothbrush bristles until soft</li>
        <li>Apply toothpaste to your tooth brush bristles</li>
        <li>Brush your teeth for two minutes until clean</li>
        <li>Rinse your tooth brush clean</li>
        <li>Repeat morning and night</li>
      </ul> 
    </p>

    <h3>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3>
    <p>
      The Document Object Model (DOM) is effectively a application programming interface which determines how the browser interface interprets the page to look like in the browser to a user, for example the browser would read the HTML document and start building the structure of the website like head and body etc.

    <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
    <p>
        The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects is that in an array you only need a position eg. 
    </p>
    <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>
    <p>
      Functions are like recipes, they allow you to create a series of code lines to run as a group or function like the instructions in a recipe. These are super helpful for grouping the relative components involved in a particular function and tidying up your code.
