    <h2>Emotional Itelligence</h2>
    <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
    <p>
      To have a high level of emotional intelligence is effectively having the ability to be self aware of your your emotions and how they effect everything you do. To have a high EQ you must also understand how you can handle and react to these emotions.
    </p>
    <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
    <p>
      EQ and IQ differ significantly, as IQ is a standardised test (IQ Test) used to measure the intelectual intelligence of an individual by taking a test which touches on a range of areas like your analytical thinking, mathematical ability and spatial recognition. EQ or emotional itelligence on the other hand is a measurement/guage of how intune you are with your emotions and the emotions of others and having the tools to be able to handle these emotions empathetially.
    </p>

    <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
    <p>
      EQ is extremely important in the fact everything in life is built around relationships and having a high EQ will allow you to understand both yourself and the people you interact with on an emotional level which will in turn help to build more meaningfull connections and collaborations.
