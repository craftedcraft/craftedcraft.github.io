    <h3>Describe the impact the core learning has had on your Foundations learning journey.</h3>
    <p>
      The cultural and core learning curriculum has had a massive impact on my foundations learning journey, 
      it has allowed me to better understand myself and how important EQ is and how it can completely change 
      your outlook.
    </p>

    <h3>What are 1 - 3 new things you have learned about yourself as a result of the core learning?</h3>
    <p>
      These exercises have allowed me to learn a number of new things about myself and how I see others, some things 
       I knew about myself but has allowed me to explore and understand them in more detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>I've learnt in more detail how I need to get into a state of focuss to maximise my efficiency, I've always 
          explored this but I've learnt a few more tricks to ensure I'm aware when my attention is getting hijacked.
        </li>
        <li>
          I've learnt I'm a good listener but not a very good at articulating my thoughts.
        </li>
        <li>
          I've learnt that it's ok not to know everything and to be comfortable in not knowing because it is and area I'll experince a lot in this journey.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
    <p>
      Personally the core learning curriculum has been most surprising in the fact of it's importance. It makes total sense but seems to be neglected by a number organisations.
    </p>

    <h3>What was the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
    <p>
      The most challenginng part for me was getting the core learning into words, I've always been quite visual and this is an onging challenge for me.
    </p>

    <h3>Any thoughts you want to share about your core learning journey in Foundations?</h3>
    <p>
      I feel these cultural and core skills are imensly important not only within the tech industry but in life in general so I'm glad they're prioritised.
