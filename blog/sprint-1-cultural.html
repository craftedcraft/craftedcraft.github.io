    <h2> Identity, Values and Strengths Activity </h2>  
    
    <h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</h3>
    <h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.
                </li>
        </ul>
    </h3>
 <p>
        I had to make an ethical decision to retire from rugby in 2015 after a severe concusion, I had a under a number of internal and external pressures to continue playing the game I loved (my dream was to be an All Black and had been since I can remember). The decision to step back came from reflecting on what was important to me and my partner. At the end of the day I had to be honest to myself, partner and family in how the concusion was affecting me both physically and mentally.  
 </p>
 <h3>
     <ul>
         <li>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</li>
     </ul>
    </h3>
 <p>
        My culture has influenced my values and identity immensely, my father is maori and my mother is paheka so I draw on both to define me as a person. I’m a proud maori albeit brought up in a very westernised environment. My culture and upbringing has directly influenced my reliniency, and hard work ethic. I believe your culture plays a big part in defining who you are. My core values are:
 </p>
 <p>    
     <ul>
        <li>Respect</li>
        <li>Trustworthy</li>
        <li>Freindly & helpful</li>
        <li>Agile & resilient</li>
        <li>Be #1, but train like #2</li>
        <li>Think bigger & always innovating</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3> Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations. </h3>
<h3> 
    <ul>
    <li>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development </li>
</ul>
</h3>

<p>
        Strengths - I’m a very passionate person who has always had to work extremely hard for everything in my life, from school to personal goals and career development. Hard work and resilience are certain strengths. I like to think I can get along with a wide range of personalities. I’m a deep thinker and like to contemplate on things before presenting an answer.
        In terms of career development I was focused on my professional rugby career until that was taking away from me, since then I launched ‘Craft Smoothie’ an online smoothie delivery subscription service which delivers smoothie boxes nation-wide. You quickly learn your strengths and weaknesses when founding a business from scratch and having to wear a number of hats. Believe it or not but there are a number of parallels between professional team sport and business.
        
        Work ons - Prioritising is something I’m working hard on as I have a lot going on at anyone time. I’m easily side tracked so this is something I need to keep at the forefront so I can minimise this habbit. 
        I have a tendency to underestimate the time it will take to complete tasks, this is something I’m experimenting with using the allocated time blocks and really trying to focus on the single task at hand.        
</p>
<h3>
<ul>
    <li> Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.
        </li>
</ul>
</h3>
<p> Work ethic and resilience will help me through this learning journey, when I’m passionate about something I’ll find a way to make it work.
    </p>
    <h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</li>
            </ul>
        </h3>
            
            <p>I coach a prem club rugby team (NPOB) and the Taranaki U19 representative side so I’ve had a number of instances where you’re working with a number of different personalities and your goal is to bring the group together and create a culture which allows individual players to thrive while on a journey for common team goal. This is crucial to any collaborative success.
                One example was this year after a mediocre first round for our standards we were challenging our game plan and strategy moving forward into the second round with our leaders. There was a slight conflict in what was the best fit/priority in adapting our game plan going forward into the second round. The solution was to brain dump everything working well/not well and looking for common trends, we then voiced all possible paths in detail laying out the pros and cons of each before having a vote and narrowing down to two options which we presented to the whole team. I think by involving everyone in the decision making process you get real buy in for the common goal. We went on to win the Taranaki Club Competition.</p>
