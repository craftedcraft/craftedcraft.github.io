    <h3>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Discuss how understanding the principals of neuroplaticity benefits people</li>
      <li>Discuss how you might engage with the principals of neuroplaticity for your own benefit</li>
      <li>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplaticity</li>
      <li>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      By understanding the principles of neuroplticity you can lift the ceiling on your capability.
      It allows you to work within a non restrictive framework and helps you to create more 
      permanent/reinforced neuro connections in the brain. I will look to put these principles in to 
      use while improving any existing skills or learning new ones in all aspects of my life so this 
      becomes a habit. 
    <br>
      A good way to increase neuroplaticity is to try and form as many connections to the newly learnt 
      skill as possible, so this might be preforming the skill in a different context or explaining it in a new way.

    <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</li>
      <li>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</li>
      <li>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       I found it surprising seeing the statistics from studies showing how effective mental practice is, 
       this is always something I've personally believed in while trying to improve skills on the footy field. 
       The stats surpissed me. Itâ€™s important to strengthen your neurological pathways by imagining the skills 
       you are learning and putting them in to practice, not only physically but equally as importantly mentally 
       (powerful combination). It is also important to have strong beliefs in what you are setting out to achieve.

      A number of these points reinforced attributes I live by daily. I will integrate this in a more immersive 
      way by being more self aware and focusing on using this mindset.

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I believe these understandings will heavily influence my learning plan as some of these points which have been 
      slipping have been reinforced. I will implement them into my learning plan stratergy going forward by keeping 
      some of the key points at the for front of my learning document.
